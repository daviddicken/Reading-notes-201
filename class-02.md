JavaScript data types:
* Numeric
* String
* Boolean
* Arrays
* Objects
* Undefined
* Null

A way of declaring multiple variables is

var price, quantity, total;
price = 5
quantity = 14;
total = price * quantity

Creating a Array:

var colors;
colors = ['white', 'black', 'costum']; 

data stored in a array starts at 0
to access white in the colors array would be:
colors[0]

A if statement evaluates a condition to determine what line of code is ran next.
if you use && both expressions have to be true to return true
|| only one expression has to be true to return true
placing a ! in front of a expression reverses the out put if it is true it will return false and vice versa

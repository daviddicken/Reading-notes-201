## List
There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
Ordered lists use numbers.
Unordered lists use bullets.
Definition lists are used to define terminology.
Lists can be nested inside one another.

## Boxes
CSS treats each HTML element as its own box.
You can adjust the borders, margins, and padding for each box.
You can change the borders syle color, width, ect.
You can round corners, hide boxes, add images or shadows to the borders.

## Switch Statements
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. That variable is compared to each case. If a match is found then the code found in that case is ran and then will break out of the switch statement.
If no match is found then the default will be ran.

## Falsy
These values are treated as false
* false
* 0
* a empty string
* NaN (not a number)
* a empty variable

Almost everything else can be treated as a truthy

## Loops

* for loops - will execute the code in the loop 'x' amount of times

* while loop - will execute the code in the loop until a certain condition is met

* do-while loop - will execute the code in the loop as long as a certain condition remains true

# Links
Links are created by placing href="thelink">Text you want user to click on to go to link< in between a opening and closing a tag.

It is better to use a relative url when linking to other pages on the same site.

To open up a users email program with a to email filled out alread put "mailto:the email address" after thge href.

You can link to specif parts of a page by targeting an id.

#Layout

* Block level elements start on a new line.
examples: h1 p ul li

* Inline elements flow between surrounding text.
examples: img b i

### Flow
Browsers show web pages in normal flow unless otherwisespecified.

* Normal flow -
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.

* Relative Positioning -
This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. 

* Absolute positioning -
This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element.

A fixed position element stays in one place and doesn't move with the page when a user scrolls up or down.

Floating elements take a element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.

# Screen Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide

Web designers try to put important info in the top 570-600 pixels to attempt to get the user to scroll down.

Fixed width layouts do not change with the as the user increases or decreases their browser window.

Liquid Layouts stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.

# Grids

A grid structure helps position items on a page making your eye flow nicely over the page. 


# Functions

A function allows you to group lines of code together. You can then call on that function in multiple different places cutting down on duplicate code.

# Pair Programming

Pair programming is two people working together on one code. One person is the driver writing the code and the other person is the navigator using words to guide the driver but not actually typing code. This will allow them to research and tackle problems faster along with many other benefits. Two heads are better then one.
